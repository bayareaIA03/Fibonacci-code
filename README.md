Fibonnaci

Given a number n, return the n-th fibonacci number.

A fibonacci number is calculated by finding the sum of the two preceding fibonacci numbers. The zero-th fibonacci number is 0, the first is 1, the second is 1, the third is 2, etc. The first 10 fibonacci numbers are:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, â€¦

Assume n can be any number from 0 to 100.
